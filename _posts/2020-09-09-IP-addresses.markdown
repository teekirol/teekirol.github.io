Some more precise terminology, relative to yesterday:

Parts of an IPv4 address are referred to as **octets**, and there are 4 of them. I suppose they're called octets because they're represented by 8 bits.

The **network identifier** (denoted by `Y` below) and **host identifier** (denoted by `Z` below) together make up the address, and the number of octets that each identifier has differs depending on the class.


| Class | IP
|-------|--------
| A     | `YYY.ZZZ.ZZZ.ZZZ`
| B     | `YYY.YYY.ZZZ.ZZZ`
| C     | `YYY.YYY.YYY.ZZZ`
